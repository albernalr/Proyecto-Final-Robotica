[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:30 (add_library):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target phantom_control
  because files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libconsole_bridge.so.1.0] in /home/alejandro/.local/share/mamba/envs/ros_env/lib may be hidden by files in:
      /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
