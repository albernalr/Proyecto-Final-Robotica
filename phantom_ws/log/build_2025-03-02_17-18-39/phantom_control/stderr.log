[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddynamixel_sdk.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "dynamixel_sdk", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dynamixel_sdk"
  with any of the following names:

    dynamixel_sdkConfig.cmake
    dynamixel_sdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dynamixel_sdk" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "dynamixel_sdk_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "dynamixel_sdk" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
